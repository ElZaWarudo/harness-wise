  Gitflow-based commit workflow: ensure work happens on a properly named feature

# Gitflow Knight

## Overview

Create clean, user-approved commits following a gitflow-style process: correct branch first, then plan commits, then execute them.

## Workflow

### 0) Operating rules (non-negotiable)

- Never add "Co-authored-by" lines (or any LLM attribution) to commit messages.
- Use one commit-plan acceptance gate when acting standalone. If this skill is running inside an already accepted `krt-release-marshal` workflow, do not add extra approval gates for local/reversible steps unless required information is missing or the action becomes destructive/external.
- Prefer non-interactive commands. Avoid `git add -p` unless the user explicitly wants an interactive hunk workflow.
- Use the host runtime's command wrapper only when the current repo requires one. The command examples below use plain `git` for portability.
- Do not run tests, linters, or formatters unless the user explicitly asks.

### 1) Preflight (do not change anything yet)

- Determine current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Inspect working tree and staging:
  - `git status --porcelain=v1 -b`
  - `git diff --name-only`
  - `git diff --cached --name-only`
- If there are no changes (staged or unstaged), stop and tell the user there is nothing to commit.
- If `git branch --show-current` returns empty, treat it as detached HEAD and ask before creating a branch.

### 2) Enforce gitflow branch hygiene

Goal: all subsequent steps happen on a correctly named feature branch.

- Identify protected/base branches:
  - Treat `main`, `master`, and `develop` as protected (do not commit directly on them).
  - Determine base branch:
    - If `develop` exists locally or on origin, prefer `develop`.
    - Else fall back to `main` (or `master` if that is the default branch).
- Validate current branch name against a simple convention:
  - Allowed types: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `perf/`, `build/`, `ci/`
  - Slug: `kebab-case` (letters/digits and hyphens)
  - Example: `feat/tire-family-schema-registry`

Use `develop`/`main` as branch hygiene and PR-target context. Do not change the commit base unless the working tree is clean and the intended base is clear from the user request or enclosing workflow plan.

If the current branch is protected, detached, empty, or off-convention:

1. Propose a branch name based on the user request (or ask the user to provide one).
2. Include the exact branch name in the commit plan acceptance gate. If running under an already accepted `krt-release-marshal` plan and the branch name is clear, proceed without a separate branch-name gate.
3. After the relevant plan gate, switch to it safely:
   - If there are uncommitted changes, create from current HEAD: `git switch -c <branch>`
   - If the working tree is clean and the base is clear, create from base: `git switch -c <branch> <base>`
   - Or switch: `git switch <branch>`

If the user wants to rename an existing local-only branch and the target name is clear, proceed. If the branch has already been pushed, ask first because the remote implications are external.

### 3) Build a commit plan

Goal: split pending work into atomic commits with clear messages.

- Collect changed files (staged + unstaged) and group them into commits using simple heuristics:
  - `docs/` -> `docs(<scope>): ...`
  - `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/` -> `test(<scope>): ...`
  - Build/CI files -> `ci(...)` / `build(...)` / `chore(...)`
  - Product code changes -> `feat(...)` / `fix(...)` / `refactor(...)` depending on intent
- If the user explicitly says to include all files or all changes, the plan must include every staged, unstaged, and untracked file. Do not exclude "unrelated" files by default; instead group them into separate atomic commits and call out their domain clearly.
- If staged changes exist before planning, pause and classify them:
  - Keep staged changes as "Commit 0".
  - Unstage and rebuild the whole plan.
  - Commit staged changes separately with a planned message.
- Do not mix pre-staged changes with newly staged files unless the commit plan explicitly includes that grouping.
- Prefer file-level grouping. If a single file mixes multiple concerns, propose either:
  - a small refactor to split changes first, or
  - an interactive/hunk-based staging approach (only with user approval).
- Default to whole-file commits. If atomicity requires splitting a file, stop and ask whether the user wants interactive/hunk staging. Do not attempt partial staging automatically.

Commit messages should use `type(scope): imperative summary`.

Rules:

- Use a lowercase type.
- Scope is optional but preferred when obvious.
- Avoid a trailing period.
- Keep the summary under ~72 characters when practical.
- Describe user-visible or maintenance value, not implementation mechanics.
- Do not include orchestration IDs such as `RDM-001`, `U1`, package numbers, or date sequences unless the user or repo convention explicitly requires them.

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add token refresh flow`
- `fix(api): preserve pagination filters`
- `docs(readme): clarify local setup`

Present the plan to the user as the single local commit-plan gate:

- Commit 1: `<message>`
  - Files: `path/a`, `path/b`
- Commit 2: `<message>`
  - Files: `path/c`

Ask the user to approve the plan (and any exact commit messages) before staging or committing, unless an enclosing `krt-release-marshal` plan already approved the same branch and commit grouping.

### 4) Execute commits

For each commit in the accepted plan:

- Stage only the planned files: `git add <paths...>`
- Quote paths with spaces or shell-sensitive characters.
- Sanity-check staged files:
  - `git diff --cached --name-status`
  - `git diff --cached --stat`
- Only inspect the full staged diff when needed for correctness or when the user asks.
- Create the commit:
  - `git commit -m "<exact approved message>"`
  - Keep the message clean; do not add trailers/footers.

If there were already staged changes before this workflow started:

- Treat them explicitly as "Commit 0" in the plan, or ask the user if you should unstage and restage by plan.
- Never run `git restore --staged .` without user approval.

### 5) Post-commit checks

- Show what is left: `git status`
- Show recent commits for confidence only if useful or requested: `git log -n 5 --oneline`
- If there is still pending work, loop back to "Build a commit plan".
