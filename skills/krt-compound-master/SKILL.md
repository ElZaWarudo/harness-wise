description: >
  Discovery-gated artifact-first orchestrator for compound-engineering product delivery. Resolves roadmap/readiness generation,
  runs brainstorm/plan/document-review loops, derives mergeable work packages with focused review units, executes each review unit
  through resolved work/code-review roles, and hands shipping to krt-release-marshal with CI break-prevention evidence. Use when
  turning an existing documented software project into a sequenced roadmap and PR/Jira delivery program. Runtime aliases may expose
  this as krt:compound-master.

# Compound Master

Coordinate existing skills. Do not replace Compound Engineering, do not duplicate `krt-release-marshal`, and do not ship from the work phase.

Arguments:

```text
[initiative description or docs path]
[mode:artifacts|mode:execute|mode:full|mode:resume]
[package:<work-package-path>]
[review-unit:<RU#>]
[pr-granularity:auto|review-unit|work-package|roadmap-item|plan-unit]
[jira-policy:required|optional|skip]
[production:unknown|live|preprod|prototype]
[parallel:true|false]
[delegation:auto|ask|inline]
[autonomy:manual|guarded|high]
[review-threshold:P0-P2|P0-P1|P0]
[subagent-model:<runtime-specific-model>]
```

Default posture: artifact-first after discovery. Generate durable artifacts from explicit context and user decisions; execute later only when the user explicitly asks or `mode:full` reaches its execution gate.

## Progressive Loading

Load only what the current phase needs:

| Phase | Load |
|---|---|
| Preflight, roles, arguments, paths | `references/role-and-runtime.md` |
| Artifact workflow and gates | `references/workflow-map.md` |
| Work-package templates and review-unit shape | `references/artifact-templates.md` |
| Execution routing | `references/execution-flow.md` |
| Delegation and worker prompts | `references/execution-delegation.md` |
| Impact scans and verification evidence | `references/impact-verification.md` |
| Code review, security, and CI handling | `references/review-security-ci.md` |
| Release handoff | `references/release-handoff.md` |
| State, blockers, and closeouts | `references/status-and-failures.md` |

Before writing or reviewing a work package, run:

```bash
python3 skills/krt-compound-master/scripts/check_work_package.py <work-package.md>
```

## Core Pipeline

1. Preflight roles, repo, branch, delegation, Jira readiness, production posture, and context.
2. Invoke the resolved roadmap generator for exactly one roadmap or readiness report.
3. Review the roadmap or stop on readiness.
4. Run one interactive brainstorm per roadmap item before finalizing requirements.
5. Review each brainstorm/requirements artifact.
6. Run one plan per reviewed requirements artifact.
7. Review each plan.
8. Derive work packages with focused review units; review units are the default PR/Jira units.
9. Review work packages and their review-unit breakdown.
10. Execute each ready review unit with the resolved work role in implementation-only/no-shipping mode.
11. Keep Security Sentinel watch active by default for high-risk review units.
12. Review implementation with the resolved code-review role and loop fixes until the configured threshold passes.
13. Run the resolved security review role for high-risk review units before release handoff.
14. Record CI break-prevention evidence.
15. Hand the finished review unit to `krt-release-marshal`, which owns commits, rebase, Jira, PR creation, reviewers, PR backlinking, and Jira transition.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Resolve every referenced role from available skills, commands, or agents. Never guess short names.
- Treat canonical hyphenated skill names as portable; runtime aliases are optional.
- Treat `Skill("<role>", "...")` examples as pseudocode and translate them to the current runtime.
- Use document-review roles for documents and code-review roles for implementation/diffs.
- Do not implement before a written and reviewed plan exists.
- Do not continue past roadmap generation when context is insufficient.
- Do not skip interactive brainstorm unless explicitly asked to skip discovery or run non-interactively; record the override and risks.
- Do not invent product behavior, authorization rules, data contracts, Jira transitions, release constraints, branch bases, or dependency edges.
- Give agents explicit decision rights before execution; escalate product behavior, auth/data contracts, destructive operations, public contract removal, branch/base strategy, Jira/PR workflow, and production compatibility breakage.
- Do not invent production posture. Use `production:unknown` unless explicit user context or strong repo evidence supports another value.
- Treat `production:live` as compatibility-preserving; breaking existing behavior requires explicit approval and rationale.
- Use repo-relative paths in generated documents.
- Do not edit CE plan bodies as progress checklists; progress lives in state, work-package status, task tracking, commits, Jira, and PRs.
- A PR unit is a review unit, not automatically a work package and not every plan bullet.
- Split broad work packages into review units when review would otherwise be noisy.
- Target <=500 human-authored changed lines per review-unit PR, warn above 900, and require split/rationale above ~1,000. Count generated artifacts, schema dumps, and orchestration docs separately.
- Do not mix `docs/brainstorms`, `docs/plans`, `docs/work-packages`, or `docs/orchestration/compound-master-state.md` into functional PRs unless the PR is explicitly documentation/orchestration or the user approves the mixed surface.
- Put large generated artifacts or mechanical `*.auto.*` outputs in a separate review unit/commit when practical.
- Keep planning IDs out of human-facing release text.
- Do not let work invoke PR creation, Jira transitions, or shipping workflows.
- Do not open PRs from protected branches.
- Treat verification results as release-readiness evidence, not public PR copy.
- Require an Impact Scan before `review-passed` when a review unit changes API contracts, endpoints, bindings, shared helpers, schemas, payloads, auth/tenant/ownership behavior, or fixture contracts.
- Use a verification ladder: targeted diagnostic, natural affected suite, then repo-specific CI-equivalent command before release handoff or CI-fix PR update.
- Treat PR creation as a handoff milestone, not proof that CI is healthy.
- Never ask for Jira credentials.

## Stop Discipline

Whenever this skill stops, return a visible closeout with current phase/status, written or updated paths, ready work, blockers or "No blockers", recommended next action, and exact next invocation.

Do not stop between a passing work/verification/review loop and `krt-release-marshal`; the user-facing approval pause belongs inside `krt-release-marshal`.

When a package waits on an open parent PR and the user says "continue", fetch and inspect the integration base before choosing the next review unit. Prefer a stacked PR from the parent review-unit branch only when the base check supports it; record dependency context in state, not PR body.

## Workflow Map

For artifact generation, load `references/workflow-map.md`.

For execution, load `references/execution-flow.md`, then only the phase file it points to.

For state and failure handling, load `references/status-and-failures.md`.
