# Workflow Map

Load for artifact generation and high-level resume decisions. Load phase-specific execution references only when the workflow reaches execution.

## Step 0 - Preflight

Load `role-and-runtime.md`. Resolve roles, runtime/delegation availability, repo status, integration base, working tree, production posture, and Jira env var presence. Do not print tokens.

In `mode:resume`, compact or selectively load state before broad ingestion when state would crowd context.

Production posture:

- Accept explicit argument first.
- Otherwise infer only from strong evidence: production deploy docs, live config, incidents/runbooks, release history, real user/data language, or explicit prototype/sandbox language.
- If evidence is mixed or weak, set `production:unknown` and ask before risky persistence, API, auth, tenant, deployment, deletion, migration, or workflow changes.
- Record posture, evidence, confidence, and consequences in state and downstream artifacts.

## Step 1 - Roadmap Generator Gate

Invoke `roadmap_generator`. It must return exactly one:

```text
artifact_kind: roadmap | readiness-report
artifact_path: docs/...
```

If readiness report, update state and stop with a context-blocked closeout. If roadmap, update state and continue.

## Step 2 - Roadmap Review

Review the roadmap with `document_review`. Fix blockers without inventing behavior. Ask only when findings change scope, behavior, dependency order, or PR strategy.

## Step 3 - Brainstorm Per Roadmap Item

For each roadmap item in dependency order, invoke `brainstorm` for that item only. Keep it interactive unless the current invocation explicitly requested non-interactive discovery.

The brainstorm gate finishes with:

```text
brainstorm_path: docs/brainstorms/...
planning_input_path: docs/brainstorms/...
requirements_decisions: captured | assumption-backed
open_decisions: none | [...]
```

Review `planning_input_path` before planning. If brainstorm was skipped, record the override and assumptions.

## Step 4 - Plan Per Reviewed Requirements Artifact

Invoke `plan` for each reviewed `planning_input_path`. Verify stable U-IDs, dependencies, repo-relative paths, test scenarios, and verification criteria. Review plans until no blocking findings remain.

## Step 5 - Derive Work Packages

Load `artifact-templates.md`. Create delivery packages under `docs/work-packages/RDM-###-<roadmap-item-slug>/` with focused review units.

Each package must:

- Align included/excluded/split/deferred origin plan units.
- Define review units as the normal PR/Jira handoff units.
- Justify any review unit that mixes runtime logic with large generated artifacts or orchestration docs.
- Pass `<compound-master-skill-dir>/scripts/check_work_package.py`.
- Pass `document_review`.

If `mode:artifacts`, stop after artifact closeout with exact next invocation, including `review-unit:<RU#>` when known.

## Step 6 - Execution Wave Planning

Load `execution-flow.md`, then `execution-delegation.md`. Resolve autonomy/delegation and classify packages and review units as independent, dependent, overlapping, high-risk, and production-sensitive.

Execute serially unless `parallel:true`, `autonomy:high`, dependencies, isolation, and non-overlapping scopes make parallel execution safe.

## Step 7 - Execute Review Unit

Load `execution-delegation.md`. Invoke `work` in implementation-only/no-shipping mode for the selected review unit. Start Security Watch for high-risk review units. Inspect worker output, update state, run/attempt verification, and continue to review.

## Step 8 - Code Review And Fix Loop

Load `review-security-ci.md`. Invoke `code_review`, prefer autofix when safe, retry with report-only/inline only if runtime refuses agent launch. Loop findings at or above threshold through work and review. Stop after three blocked rounds.

## Step 9 - Security Sentinel Gate

Load `review-security-ci.md`. Run security review for high-risk review units, feeding Security Watch notes into the gate. Blockers loop back through work and code review before release handoff.

## Step 10 - CI Break-Prevention And Escalation

Load `impact-verification.md` and `review-security-ci.md`. Record contract-drift scan, consumer tests, surface-aware verification, and CI-only gaps. Do not poll CI in a loop.

## Step 11 - Release Marshal Handoff

Load `release-handoff.md`. Handoff the completed review unit to `krt-release-marshal`; do not duplicate its procedures.

## Step 12 - Continue Waves Or Finish

Refresh state, dependencies, and integration base after each PR handoff. If a parent PR is pending, fetch and inspect the integration base before continuing from the parent review-unit branch. Record stack/dependency context in state, not PR body.

## State Archive Hygiene

Invoke `state_archivist` after major gates when state grows noisy: roadmap review, artifact set review, implementation/review/security gates, before long closeouts, after PR handoff, and before resume loads large state.
