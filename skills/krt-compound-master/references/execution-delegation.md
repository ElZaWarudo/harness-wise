# Execution Delegation

Load for wave planning, delegation decisions, and worker invocation.

## Wave Planning

Classify packages and review units:

- Independent: no hard dependency and no dangerous file overlap.
- Dependent: requires another package, branch, PR, schema, API, or merged change.
- Overlapping: touches files also touched by another package/review unit.
- High-risk: auth, security, payments, PII, migrations, public API, deployment, permissions, external APIs, shared contracts.
- Production-sensitive: `production:live` or `production:unknown` plus changes to existing behavior, persistence, API contracts, auth/tenant rules, deployment/config, migrations, data deletion, user workflows, or rollback expectations.

Rules:

- Independent review units may branch from the integration base.
- Dependent review units wait for merge or become stacked PRs based on parent branch.
- Overlapping/high-risk/production-sensitive review units run serially unless the user explicitly accepts risk and isolation exists.
- `parallel:true` requires isolated worktrees/checkouts, non-overlapping scopes, safe dependencies, and `autonomy:high`.
- Without isolation, delegated workers must not stage, commit, push, create PRs, transition Jira, or run broad mutation-prone flows.

If execution has no `package:`, select the first unblocked package and first ready review unit from the earliest safe wave. If the package has no review units, derive them before execution using `artifact-templates.md`.

## Delegation Matrix

| Review-unit shape | Default choice |
|---|---|
| Small/same-file/tightly coupled | Run inline |
| Many files or uncertain conventions | Launch one read-only explorer |
| Clear scope, ownership, verification, autonomy contract, and no open decision | Launch at most one worker |
| Risky or fresh perspective needed | Use code review plus optional read-only fan-out |
| Independent, isolated, non-overlapping units | Parallel workers only with explicit safe mode |
| Ambiguous ownership, overlap, missing isolation, or product/branch decision | Run inline or stop for decision |

## Autonomy Contract

Every work package/review unit should state:

- Agent may decide: reversible, package-local, convention-following choices.
- Agent must record: inferred conventions, low-risk path choices, skipped verification with blocker, compatible adjustments.
- Agent must escalate: product behavior, auth/tenant/data contract rules, public API compatibility, destructive persistence, production deployment/rollback, branch/base strategy, Jira/PR workflow, credentials, paid resources, or scope outside the review unit.

## Work Invocation

Before invoking work, verify the resolved `work` role supports implementation-only/no-shipping mode.

Prompt shape:

```text
Skill("<work>", "<work-package-path>

Review unit: <RU# and title>

Execution constraint: implement only the selected review unit and run the verification you can run inside your assigned scope. Use the package autonomy contract: decide reversible, package-local, convention-following choices; record assumptions; escalate only non-inferable product, contract, security, production, branch/base, Jira/PR, credential, or scope decisions. Preserve the origin plan's implementation units: for each included U-ID/unit, report status, changed files, verification attempted/results/skips, and blockers. Do not implement later review units unless required to keep this unit coherent and explicitly recorded. Do not invoke PR creation, ce-commit-push-pr, Jira transitions, or any shipping workflow. Leave pending commits/changes for the lead and krt-release-marshal. Return changed files, API/contract changes detected, verification attempted, verification results, skipped verification with reasons, decisions made autonomously, and any unresolved questions. Do not ask the user to take over normal local verification or review.")
```

## Completion Gate

Mark a review unit implementation-complete only when:

- Expected files changed/created for the selected review unit.
- Each included plan unit has disposition: implemented, verified, skipped with reason, or blocked.
- Production posture evidence is satisfied or explicit gap/rationale is recorded.
- Impact Scan complete when required.
- Relevant tests run or no-test justification recorded.
- Consumer-derived tests from Impact Scan run or skipped with concrete blocker.
- Pending changes/commits are coherent for one review unit.
- No unresolved product decision remains.

After worker return, inspect summary/diff by review unit and plan unit, update state, collect Security Watch notes, run verification or closest targeted tests, fix straightforward failures inline or through work, and continue only when the selected review unit has a non-pending disposition.
