# Artifact Templates

Use this reference when Compound Master writes work packages, artifact closeouts, or final summaries.

Roadmap and readiness report templates are owned by the resolved `roadmap_generator` role, canonically `krt-roadmap-cartographer`. Compound Master consumes those artifacts; it does not define their canonical shape here.

## Work Package

Path:

```text
docs/work-packages/RDM-###-<roadmap-item-slug>/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<package-slug>-work-package.md
```

Use a work package as the atomic PR/Jira unit. It may include one roadmap item, one plan U-ID, or a cohesive group of U-IDs. Do not store all work packages in one flat directory; organize them under the roadmap item folder they belong to.

Split when units have independent value, minimal file overlap, separate risk domains, and clean independent verification. Combine when units share migrations/API contracts/core files, depend tightly on each other, or would create noisy stacked PRs. A package may implement the full roadmap item in one integrated PR only when the plan units have strong integration/dependency coupling; this must be explicit in the grouping rationale.

Work packages must align with origin plan units. A package may combine or split units, but it must make that relationship explicit and justify it. If a plan defines U1-U5, the package must say which of those units are included, excluded, deferred, or split into another package.

# [Work package title]

## Scope
[Only what this package implements]

## Non-goals
[Explicit exclusions]

## Autonomy Contract
- Mode: [manual|guarded|high]
- Agent may decide without asking: [reversible, package-local choices such as internal naming, equivalent verification commands, small fixture/test updates, convention-following implementation details]
- Agent must record as assumptions: [repo conventions inferred, low-risk path choices, skipped verification with blocker, compatible adjustments]
- Agent must escalate: [product behavior, authorization/tenant/data contracts, destructive data operations, public API breakage, production deployment/rollback impact, branch/base strategy, Jira/PR workflow, credentials, paid external resources, or scope outside this package]
- Safe fallback: [continue exploration/tests/implementation that do not depend on the blocked decision; otherwise return the blocked decision and exact next question]

## Dependencies
- Requires: [None / package IDs / branch / PR]
- Blocks: [package IDs]

## Production Posture
- Posture: [unknown|live|preprod|prototype]
- Evidence: [user statement, docs/config/release evidence, or "not established"]
- Confidence: [high|medium|low]
- Consequences for this package: [compatibility expectations, migration/deployment caution, or speed/flexibility allowed]
- Breaking existing behavior allowed: [no / only with explicit approval / yes because prototype and approved]

## Plan Unit Alignment
| Plan unit | Included in this package | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| U1 | yes/no/partial | [Why included, excluded, deferred, or split] |

Grouping rationale:
- [Why these units belong in the same PR/Jira unit, or why this package contains only part of the roadmap item]

## Implementation Units
[Relevant U-ID summaries, preserving origin plan unit names and order]

## Files and Tests
[Repo-relative files and expected tests]

## Impact Scan
- Changed API contracts/endpoints/bindings/helpers/schemas/payloads/auth/tenant/ownership/test fixtures: [None / list]
- Consumer scan patterns: [None / rg/search patterns]
- Consumers found: [None / repo-relative files and flows]
- Contract-drift tests searched: [None / exact-list expectations, snapshots, allowlists, role/permission bundle tests, normalization tests, seeded fixtures]
- Required consumer tests: [None / commands or test files]
- Consumer tests run/skipped: [commands/results, or skip reason and whether CI covers it]

## Verification Gate
- [Commands/outcomes that must pass]
- Surface-aware evidence: [changed surfaces and the test/inspection evidence for each]
- Production posture evidence: [for live/unknown systems, regression/compatibility/migration/rollback evidence required for touched surfaces; for prototype, note any intentionally relaxed checks]

## Review Gate
- Code review threshold: [configured `review-threshold`; default P0-P2]
- Findings below threshold: log unless user marks blocking

## Security Gate
- Run after work-review loop: [not required / required because auth, secrets, PII, public API, deployment, dependency, or other high-risk surface changed]
- Security Watch during work: [enabled/disabled and why]
- Security Watch notes: [None / early concerns, suggested verification, gate inputs]
- Security reviewer: [krt-security-sentinel / fallback security reviewer / inline]
- Security review result: [pending / pass / fixes needed / blocked / advisory only]
- Required security verification: [tests/checks/manual inspection]

## CI Break-Prevention And Escalation
- CI risk surfaces: [build/typecheck/lint/tests/generated artifacts/migrations/permissions/config/etc.]
- Preventive evidence: [local verification or explicit CI-only gap for each changed surface]
- If CI breaks: [invoke krt-ci-questor with PR/run/check context; do not poll checks in Compound Master]
- Escalation rule: [record release-follow-up blocker until the CI incident has cause, owner, and next action]

## Branch and PR Handoff Inputs
- Branch name: [feat/package-slug-without-plan-number]
- PR base: [develop/main/parent branch]
- Suggested commit grouping:
  - [type(scope): summary] - [repo-relative files or surfaces] - [why this is one logical review unit]
  - [Split broad packages by changed surface: persistence/schema/model state; domain service/integration behavior; API/controller/generated contracts; config/deployment wiring; focused tests/fixtures; docs/orchestration. Omit surfaces that did not change.]
- PR title:
- PR body bullets:
- Verification results location:
- Production/deployment notes: [required for live/unknown systems when behavior, schema, config, or deployment changes; otherwise none]

## Jira Handoff Inputs
- Jira policy: [required|optional|skip]
- Suggested issue type: Tarea
- Suggested subtask behavior: create/reuse subtask when parent is provided; if no parent fits and this package may have sibling PRs/work packages, prefer creating a parent task plus a subtask for this package, with the parent added to the active sprint unless explicitly skipped
- Jira summary: [Spanish semantic title without roadmap/package numbers]
- Jira description: [Spanish concise scope/reason without roadmap/package numbers]
```

Review every package with `document_review`. Fix blockers before execution.

## Human-Facing Handoff Text

Keep internal planning identifiers out of public/reviewer-facing text:

- Do not include `RDM-001`, `U1`, date sequences, package numbers, or work-package sequence numbers in Jira summaries/descriptions, commit messages, PR titles, PR body bullets, or branch names.
- Use semantic names that describe the capability or fix: `feat/tenant-permission-bundles`, not `feat/rdm-001-tenant-permission-bundles`.
- Jira summaries should be in Spanish and read like work items a teammate would understand without the orchestration plan.
- Jira descriptions should be in Spanish and explain scope and reason in concise prose, not restate roadmap IDs or package numbers.
- PR titles and commit messages should be value-oriented and conventional; put traceability in artifact metadata, PR dependency notes, or Jira links instead of the title.
- When commit messages or PR bodies include Jira traceability, include only the immediately relevant issue link/key, usually the subtask for this PR/work package. Do not include both parent and child unless the user or repo convention explicitly asks.
- Keep IDs only in internal fields such as `roadmap_item`, `units`, origin paths, dependency tables, and state.

## Artifact Closeout

When `mode:artifacts` stops, include:

- Roadmap path.
- Brainstorm paths.
- Plan paths.
- Work-package paths.
- State path.
- Dependency waves and recommended first package.
- Branch strategy summary.
- Blockers, or "No blockers".
- Exact next invocation, for example:

```text
Use krt-compound-master mode:execute package:<work-package-path> jira-policy:<required|optional|skip> parallel:false
```

If no package is ready, say exactly why. If packages are ready, say artifact generation is complete and execution is intentionally waiting for an explicit user gate.

For `mode:full`, ask one execution gate after the artifact closeout:

```text
Artifacts are ready. Recommended next package: <work-package-path>.
Proceed with execution now?
```

## Final Summary

At the end, write:

```text
docs/orchestration/YYYY-MM-DD-compound-master-summary.md
```

Include roadmap, brainstorms, plans, packages, waves, branches, Impact Scans, security reviews, CI break-prevention evidence, surface-aware verification, review rounds, Jira tasks, PRs, surfaced CI incidents/escalations, blockers, residual advisory findings, completed packages, remaining packages by wave, and the next recommended invocation if work remains.
