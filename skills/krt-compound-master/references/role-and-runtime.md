# Role And Runtime

Load during preflight, argument parsing, and runtime/delegation setup.

## Role Resolution

Resolve these logical roles:

| Role | Canonical portable skill | Required when |
|---|---|---|
| `roadmap_generator` | `krt-roadmap-cartographer` | artifact generation |
| `brainstorm` | `ce-brainstorm` | artifact generation |
| `plan` | `ce-plan` | artifact generation |
| `document_review` | `document-review` | artifact generation |
| `state_archivist` | `krt-state-archivist` | optional state compaction |
| `work` | `ce-work` | execution |
| `code_review` | `ce-review` | execution |
| `security_review` | `krt-security-sentinel` | high-risk review units |
| `project_pr` | `krt-release-marshal` | shipping |
| `ci_investigator` | `krt-ci-questor` | optional CI escalation |
| `gitflow_commit` | `krt-gitflow-knight` | shipping component |
| `clean_rebase` | `krt-rebase-smith` | shipping component |
| `jira_workflow` | `krt-jira-scribe` | shipping with Jira |

Resolution order:

1. Exact canonical portable skill name.
2. Documented runtime alias exposed by the host.
3. If unresolved and required for the current phase, stop with the role, canonical skill, aliases checked, and blocked phase.

Missing optional roles do not block:

- Missing `state_archivist`: preserve long state and record skipped compaction.
- Missing `security_review`: resolve another security-review skill or do direct evidence-based review.
- Missing `ci_investigator`: do direct evidence-first triage if CI breaks.

Missing required shipping roles block before shipping. Missing Jira blocks only when `jira-policy:required`.

## Runtime Adapter

The portable core is role-based. Subagents are optional runtime adapters.

- Use delegated agents only when the host supports them and the work can be isolated safely.
- Keep the lead as supervisor; subagents do not coordinate with each other.
- Do not add free-form swarm behavior. Use bounded delegation and reviewer fan-out only when useful and recorded.
- Distinguish direct KRT-owned agent launch from invoking another resolved skill. Do not downgrade `document_review`, `work`, or `code_review` just because that skill may internally launch agents.

Resolve delegation at the start of execution (`mode:execute`, execution resume, or post-artifact `mode:full`):

- `delegation:inline` or "sin subagentes": no KRT-owned subagents.
- `delegation:ask`, `autonomy:manual`, `parallel:true` without `autonomy:high`, or "con subagentes": ask before mutating subagents.
- `delegation:auto`: use `autonomy:guarded` unless explicit.
- `autonomy:guarded`: read-only agents and one scoped worker may run when ownership is clear and no blocking decision remains.
- `autonomy:high`: parallel workers only with `parallel:true`, isolated worktrees/checkouts, non-overlapping scopes, dependencies, and fallback branch strategy.

Delegation budget:

- At most one mutating worker per review unit.
- At most three read-only reviewer subagents in review fan-out.
- If a subagent returns low confidence, do one targeted follow-up rather than launching generic agents.

Record delegation mode, roles used, read-only/mutating status, outcome, confidence, duration when useful, and whether delegation reduced or added loops.

## Arguments

- `mode:artifacts` default: artifact steps only.
- `mode:execute`: execute ready review units; if no `package:` is provided, choose the first unblocked package and first ready review unit from the earliest safe wave.
- `mode:full`: artifacts, execution gate, then execute the recommended review unit or safe wave.
- `mode:resume`: continue from the next incomplete state item.
- `package:<path>`: execute or resume only that work package.
- `review-unit:<RU#>`: execute or resume only that review unit.
- `production:unknown|live|preprod|prototype`: default `unknown` unless explicit context or strong repo evidence supports another value.
- `pr-granularity:auto|review-unit|work-package|roadmap-item|plan-unit`: default `auto`, but review-unit is the normal PR unit.
- `jira-policy:required|optional|skip`: default `required`.
- `parallel:false|true`: default `false`; `true` requires safe dependencies and isolation.
- `delegation:auto|ask|inline`: default `auto`.
- `autonomy:manual|guarded|high`: default `guarded`.
- `review-threshold:P0-P2|P0-P1|P0`: default `P0-P2`.
- `subagent-model:<value>`: runtime-specific advisory only.
