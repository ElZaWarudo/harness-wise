# Execution Flow

Use this reference for Compound Master Steps 6-9.

## Wave Planning

Before selecting workers or reviewer subagents, resolve the execution delegation gate from `SKILL.md`.

- If the current invocation explicitly says `delegation:inline` or "sin subagentes", do not launch KRT-owned subagents.
- If it says `parallel:true`, `delegation:ask`, or "con subagentes", treat that as intent to discuss/approve subagents and ask the gate before launching.
- If it says `delegation:auto` or omits delegation, ask the gate once at the start of execution.
- Record the answer in `compound-master-state.md` with scope, selected mode, and any runtime limitation.
- If subagents are denied or unavailable, continue inline rather than stopping.

Classify packages:

- Independent: no hard dependency and no dangerous file overlap.
- Dependent: requires another package, branch, PR, schema, API, or merged change.
- Overlapping: touches files also touched by another package.
- High-risk: auth, security, payments, PII, migrations, public API, deployment, permissions, external APIs, shared contracts.

Rules:

- Independent packages may branch from the integration base.
- Dependent packages wait for merge or become stacked PRs based on parent branch.
- Overlapping/high-risk packages run serially unless the user explicitly accepts risk and isolation exists.
- `parallel:false` forces serial execution.
- `parallel:true` requires isolated worktrees/checkouts and non-overlapping scopes.
- Parallel subagents without isolation must not stage, commit, push, create PRs, transition Jira, or run broad mutation-prone flows.

If execution was requested without `package:`, select the first unblocked package from the earliest safe wave, state why, and continue unless this changes scope, requires a stacked branch decision, or conflicts with user-provided ordering.

## Work Invocation

Before executing, verify that the resolved `work` role supports implementation-only/no-shipping mode. Stop before duplicate shipping if it cannot.

Invocation shape:

```text
Skill("<work>", "<work-package-path>

Execution constraint: implement this package only and run the verification you can run inside your assigned scope. Do not invoke PR creation, ce-commit-push-pr, Jira transitions, or any shipping workflow. Leave pending commits/changes for the lead and krt-release-marshal. Return changed files, verification attempted, verification results, skipped verification with reasons, and any unresolved questions. Do not ask the user to take over normal local verification or review.")
```

Completion gate:

- Expected files changed/created.
- Relevant tests run or a no-test justification recorded.
- Verification gate passes or a documented gap is acceptable under package risk.
- Task tracker shows implementation complete.
- Pending changes/commits are coherent and ready for `krt-release-marshal`.
- No unresolved product decision remains.

After worker return, the lead must inspect the summary/diff, start documented local services when safe, run the package verification gate or closest targeted tests, fix straightforward failures inline or through `work`, and continue to review. Stop only for missing credentials, destructive setup, paid external resources, unclear environment decisions, or non-inferable product/technical decisions.

## Code Review Loop

Preferred invocation:

```text
Skill("<code_review>", "mode:autofix plan:<origin-plan-path> base:<base-branch>")
```

Read-only fallback when mutation is unsafe:

```text
Skill("<code_review>", "mode:report-only plan:<origin-plan-path> base:<base-branch>")
```

Invoke the resolved review role normally. Do not force inline/report-only just because the skill may launch agents internally. If a resolved review invocation fails because the runtime refused agent launch, retry once with that review skill's documented inline/report-only mode and record the degraded path in state.

Loop:

1. Run review.
2. If safe autofixes were applied, rerun relevant tests.
3. Leave review-fix changes for `krt-release-marshal` commit planning unless project policy requires immediate commits.
4. For findings at or above `review-threshold`, or any gated/manual correctness, security, data, contract, or test finding:
   - write `docs/review-findings/<package-slug>-round-N.md`;
   - ask only for non-inferable decisions;
   - invoke `work` on the findings doc with the same no-shipping constraint;
   - rerun tests and review.
5. Log P3/advisory findings unless the user marks them blocking.
6. Stop after three rounds if blockers remain.

Passing gate: no actionable finding at or above threshold, no unresolved security/data/contract finding, tests pass or an acceptable verification gap is recorded, advisory findings recorded.

## Release Marshal Handoff

When implementation and review gates pass, invoke `krt-release-marshal`; do not duplicate its procedures and do not stop with "next step" when the role is available.

Handoff prompt shape:

```text
Skill("<project_pr>", "Run the full krt-release-marshal workflow for this completed work package.

Work package: <work-package-path>
Roadmap item: RDM-###
Origin plan: <origin-plan-path>
Current branch: <branch-name>
Intended base: <base-branch>
Jira policy: <required|optional|skip>
Suggested Jira summary: <summary>
Suggested Jira description: <description>
Suggested PR title: <title>
Suggested PR body bullets:
- <change>
- <change>
Verification results for release-readiness only, not PR body copy:
- <command/result>

Use krt-release-marshal exactly. Do not run tests unless the user explicitly asks; use the verification results above only to decide readiness. Do not include tests or verification summaries in the PR body unless the user, repo template, or project convention explicitly requires them. Include automatic reviewer handling in the release plan: use explicit reviewers if provided, otherwise infer a clear reviewer after PR creation and request review without asking a second time; skip reviewer assignment if no clear human reviewer exists. Include automatic post-PR Jira transition to En Revisión in the release plan when Jira context exists; after PR creation, use krt-jira-scribe and the real transition list to perform that approved transition without asking a second time.")
```

Suggested Jira summary/description, PR title/body bullets, branch name, and eventual commit messages must be semantic. Do not include roadmap IDs, U-IDs, package numbers, date sequences, or other Compound Master numbering unless the user or repo convention explicitly requires them.

PR tree safety:

- Independent PRs target integration/default branch.
- Stacked PRs target parent package branch and declare dependency in PR body.
- Do not retarget stacked PRs silently.
- Do not combine unrelated roadmap items unless grouped in one package.
- If an open PR exists for the branch, do not create a duplicate.
- If Jira is required and config is missing, stop with a configuration blocker.
- If Jira is optional and config is missing, let `krt-release-marshal` ask whether to continue without Jira.

After handoff, record Jira URL, PR URL, status, branch, base, reviewers, and blockers in state.
