# Execution Flow Router

Load this file at the start of execution. It is a router, not the full execution manual.

## Load By Need

| Need | Load |
|---|---|
| Wave planning, dependency classification, delegation, worker prompt | `execution-delegation.md` |
| Impact Scan, consumer tests, verification ladder, surface-aware evidence | `impact-verification.md` |
| Code review loop, security watch/review, optional reviewer fan-out, CI escalation | `review-security-ci.md` |
| Release Marshal handoff prompt and stacked PR handling | `release-handoff.md` |
| State transitions, blockers, closeouts | `status-and-failures.md` |

## Execution Skeleton

1. Select one review unit, not an entire work package, unless the package explicitly has a single integrated review unit.
2. Classify the selected review unit: independent, dependent, overlapping, high-risk, and production-sensitive.
3. Resolve delegation/autonomy and whether the work runs inline or through a scoped worker.
4. Run implementation-only work for the selected review unit.
5. Run/attempt review-unit verification.
6. Run Impact Scan when contracts, schemas, APIs, bindings, auth/tenant behavior, shared helpers, payloads, or fixtures changed.
7. Run code review and fix loop.
8. Run security review for high-risk review units.
9. Record CI break-prevention evidence.
10. Handoff the selected review unit to `krt-release-marshal`.

## Review-Unit Discipline

- A work package is a delivery container; a review unit is the normal PR/Jira unit.
- Execute one review unit at a time unless coupling makes that less reviewable and the rationale is recorded.
- Keep orchestration docs and generated artifacts separate when they would obscure functional review.
- Keep stack/dependency context in state or handoff notes, not PR body.
