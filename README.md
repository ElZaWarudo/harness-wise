# KRT

KRT means **Knights of the Round Table**: portable agent skills for keeping the whole Camelot of a codebase in order without asking one overcaffeinated linux squire to remember everything.

## Philosophy

KRT exists because skills need a proper keep: one place for focused agent workflows that inspect, plan, review, and coordinate work before the diff starts making royal decrees.

Each skill should cover its part of Camelot cleanly:

- small enough to load only when useful
- explicit enough that another agent can follow it
- portable across agent runtimes where possible
- opinionated enough to stop bad context from becoming bad code

The bit is medieval. The contract is not.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `$krt:harness-wise` | Build or review a compact coding harness before implementation. Good for repo reconnaissance, context curation, stale-doc checks, risk estimates, and skill recommendations. |
| `$krt:compound-master` | Orchestrate larger delivery programs: context gate, roadmap, brainstorms, plans, document reviews, work packages, execution gates, code review, and PR/Jira handoff. |
| `$krt:release-marshal` | Direct the final delivery march: commits, rebase, Jira, push, PR creation, reviewer requests, and Jira review follow-up. |
| `$krt:gitflow-knight` | Keep branch hygiene and atomic commits in formation. |
| `$krt:rebase-smith` | Re-forge branch history onto the correct base without dragging old steel into the PR. |
| `$krt:jira-scribe` | Manage Jira Server/Data Center issues, subtasks, sprints, and transitions in Spanish. |

Skills can bring their own auxiliary files: references, templates, assets, adapter configs, or agent definitions. Keep the main `SKILL.md` readable; put the heavy armor in nearby files.

## Quick Examples

Prepare a coding harness before touching a repo:

```text
Use $krt:harness-wise before adding invoice CSV export.
```

Save the harness as a markdown artifact for the next agent:

```text
Use $krt:harness-wise and generate a harness file for adding invoice CSV export.
```

Trim noisy docs before a feature:

```text
Use $krt:harness-wise docs-trim before working on billing.
```

Turn a documented initiative into delivery artifacts:

```text
Use $krt:compound-master for docs/specs/reporting.md mode:artifacts
```

Resume execution from existing orchestration state:

```text
Use $krt:compound-master mode:resume jira-policy:optional parallel:false
```

## Install

Install globally so KRT follows you between projects:

```bash
npx -y skills add ElZaWarudo/krt --skill krt:<skill-name> -g
```

Install the whole table globally:

```bash
npx -y skills add ElZaWarudo/krt --all -g
```

Install the release court globally:

```bash
npx -y skills add ElZaWarudo/krt \
  --skill krt:release-marshal \
  --skill krt:gitflow-knight \
  --skill krt:rebase-smith \
  --skill krt:jira-scribe \
  -g
```

`krt:release-marshal` expects those three companions to be available. The skills CLI supports repeated `--skill` flags and `--all`; KRT does not currently rely on automatic dependency resolution in skill frontmatter. The Mariscal can read the room, but he still needs the room installed.

Omit `-g` only when you want the skill installed into the current project. Without it, the skill may stay in this castle and fail to appear when you ride into the next repo.

Target a specific runtime when needed:

```bash
npx -y skills add ElZaWarudo/krt --skill krt:<skill-name> -g -a <agent>
```

Use `-a <agent>` when you want the skill wired into a particular agent instead of trusting autodetection. Some agents read `.agents/skills/` directly; others need the CLI to place a symlink or copy in their own directory. Name the knight you expect to answer.

Update installed skills:

```bash
npx skills update
```

If `npx` wanders into the forest:

```bash
npm exec --yes --package skills -- skills update
```

## Local Development

Edit skills in `skills/<name>/`. Keep reusable detail in `references/` or `assets/` so the top-level skill stays compact.

Validate with whichever skill validator your target runtime uses. For manual checks, install the skill into a disposable agent profile and run the quick examples above. If the agent comes back with a quest, a map, and no accidental rewrite of the kingdom, the table is holding.
